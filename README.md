*Nonparametric Reaction Coordinate Optimization with Histories: A Framework for Rare Event Dynamics*  
by Polina V. Banushkina and Sergei V. Krivov

## Overview

This repository contains analysis notebooks demonstrating the application of nonparametric reaction coordinate (RC) optimization with histories to:

- **Protein folding** (`protein_folding.ipynb`)
- **Ocean circulation (AMOC)** (`AMOC.ipynb`)
- **Underdamped Langevin dynamics** (`Langevin.ipynb`)

The core implementation of the RC optimization framework is available in a separate repository:
